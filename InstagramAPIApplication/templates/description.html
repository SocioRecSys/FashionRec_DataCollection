			Introduction:

		</strong>
	</p>
    <p>
    	Fashion Dataset Retriever operates as a server side service and provides a dataset which includes: media, user’s basic information and media information such as likes, comments, caption, and location of fashionistas’ public users for research purpose. The purpose is to perform visual and textual analysis research using deep learning.This public content will be analyzed by a researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden or other researchers who will request the dataset for research purposes only.

			Usage of Service:

		</strong>
	</p>

    <p >
	The collected dataset will be used to analyze a sample of Fashionistas’ instagram media and get understanding about their favourite fashion style (from their shared public media, caption text and received comments) and brands (from hashtags in the media caption).  Then we plan to use this information (influencing fashion styles and brands) to develop a recommendation algorithm of clothes and test its efficiency in predicting similar styles as recommendations. Also recommend similar clothes( with similar styles and brands) from their followed fashion models accounts. For this purpose ‘Fashion Dataset Retriever’ service will collect public fashionistas’ data (basic information, medias, followers, captions, locations, comments and likes’ information) and help the intelligent recommendation to work with more practical data. The recommendation idea using the instagram dataset is proposed in a paper ‘Deep Cross-Domain Fashion Recommendation’ by a Phd student, Shatha Jaradat at KTH at the ACM Recommender Systems 2017 Doctoral Symposium <sup>[1]</sup>.
